# So Why Switch?

note:
- First and foremost...

===

note:
- Just for comparison's sake

## Pull Requests by Language

<div id="chart-pull-requests"></div>

note:
- Give nod to CoffeeScript 2

### TC39

note:
- Part of what's moving JavaScript forward is TC39 and the proposal process
- Introduce changes to the ECMAScript spec in a somewhat agreed upon way

===

### Standardization

## Tooling

note:
- Many of these rely on static analysis (analyzing Abstract Syntax Tree), not to say you can't statically analyze CoffeeScript
- But there's just a lack of tooling/community around it in comparison

### Editors/IDEs

note:
- Personally, I would recommend VS Code and IntelliJ
- VSCode IntelliSense out of the box for JS

### Other Tools

- Linting: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Code Formatting: [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- Refactoring: [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift)
- Type Checking: [flow](https://flow.org/), [Tern.js](http://ternjs.net/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Bundlers: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)

note:
- TypeScript is used by VSCode for type inference + type definitions
- Bundlers utilize ES2015 module spec
  - Code splitting
  - Code liveness
